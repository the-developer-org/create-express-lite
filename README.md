# create-express-lite

create-express-lite is a command-line tool that helps you kickstart your Express.js applications by generating a boilerplate code structure. Similar to `create-react-app` for React, `npx-create-express-lite` simplifies the process of setting up a new Express.js project, allowing you to focus on building your application rather than dealing with the initial configuration.

## Getting Started

To create a new Express.js project using create-express-lite, follow these simple steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    npx create-express-lite <your-folder-name>
    ```

    Replace `<your-folder-name>` with the desired name for your project.

    or

    ```bash
    npx create-express-lite .
    ```

    To get the project files in the current directory

3. The tool will prompt you for some basic configuration options, such as package manager (npm or yarn) and whether you want to include additional features like database integration or authentication.

4. Once the setup is complete, navigate to your project folder(skip if you are already in your project folder):

    ```bash
    cd <your-folder-name>
    ```

5. Start your Express.js server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Now you have a basic Express.js application up and running!

## Features

-   **Quick Setup:** Create a new Express.js project with just one command.

-   **Customizable:** During project creation, you can choose additional features and configurations according to your project requirements.

-   **Opinionated Structure:** Follows a recommended project structure to maintain consistency and best practices.

## Directory Structure

The generated project structure follows best practices for organizing your Express.js application. Here's an overview:
